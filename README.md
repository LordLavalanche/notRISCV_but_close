The purpose of this project was to create a basic and compact processor which uses RISCV (32 bit) type instructions.
The entire code is in a single file its compact and minimalistic in nature.
There are basic instruction programs in the IMEM itself to affirm the functionality of the processor.
These programs are 1) simple counter loop 2) finding maximum in the given dataset  3) bubble sort implementation.
The testbench can be a handy tool for users to gain a rudimentary understanding of the functioning of single and doubly nested loops.
